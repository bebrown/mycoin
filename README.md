# About

People have been asking me about Bitcoin: what it is and how it works. I can explain
what it is pretty easily, but how it works is more complex. While a student can read
about its inner workings, seeing it in action is difficult since running a real
Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin client costs real money to buy in. The source code is also
difficult for the beginner to comprehend.

Mycoin (for lack of a better name) is an attempt to create a set of Python functions
to simulate the Bitcoin protocol.
